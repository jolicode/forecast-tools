                    in electronic or printed format.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>3. Disclaimer</h2>

                    limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                    or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.
                </li>
                <li>
